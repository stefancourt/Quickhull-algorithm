## 🌐 Overview

A pythonic solution to the coding of a quickhull algorithm that is used to find the convex hull of a set of points where the worst time complexity is O(n^2) and the average time complexity is O(nlog(n)). The solution is then outputted to the terminal and a gif file is present showing the optimal solution in a loop of how the nodes were picked. More points can be added or subtracted by changing the inputs within the ipynb file where the algorithm will change the solution and create a new output of points in the convex hull set and a different gif file.

## 📦 Requirements

The following libraries and packages are required to run the application. These are downloaded within the notebook.

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org)

## 🚀 Running the Application

To run the application simply make sure the dependencies are installed, if they are not you should install these by running the top cell in the notebook. You should then run the cells in a top down manner to ensure that the program runs correctly and can use certain outputs already generated. Upon completion of running all the cells, a gif file should be generated and set of points in the convex hull should be generated.
